OpenMod is a **free-to-play**, **open-source** and **fun** Sandbox mod which aims to be a **good** JBMod alternative.

Why a **JBMod** alternative? because you can't improve *perfection* (aka **Garry's Mod**).

## License 📝  

This project uses **two different licenses** depending on the part of the code:  

1. **[Source SDK License](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/master/LICENSE)**  
   Anything that comes from the Source SDK (or is based on it) is covered by Valve's Source SDK License. Make sure to check it out for all the details.  

2. **[MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)**  
   All the original stuff we've added—like custom code, assets, or maps — is licensed under MIT. This only applies to the parts of the project that don’t rely directly on the Source SDK.  

### A Few Things to Keep in Mind:  
- You can’t use or distribute anything from the Source SDK (or anything based on it) for commercial purposes unless Valve says it’s okay.  
- When contributing to this project, anything tied to the Source SDK has to stick to its license, but anything else can follow the MIT License.
